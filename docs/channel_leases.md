# Channel Leases

## Overview

Once an order has been matched in an auction, the `pool auction leases` command
can be used to examine your current set of purchased/sold channel leases. An
example output looks something like the following: 
```
üèî pool auction leases
{
        "leases": [
                {
                        "channel_point": "78cc6879c1dc1c00f22b29a06458f1335ed0fdb7d05c01b9077e3155e697bbb9:2",
                        "channel_amt_sat": 5000000,
                        "channel_duration_blocks": 144,
                        "premium_sat": 40000,
                        "execution_fee_sat": 5001,
                        "chain_fee_sat": 165,
                        "order_nonce": "eb972cd21cf1651e251c8b07d69e89c47294bae104fbdc9da26edf9aee335c9a",
                        "purchased": false
                }
        ],
        "total_amt_earned_sat": 40000,
        "total_amt_paid_sat": 5166
}
```

Here we can see I sold a channel for 40k satoshis, and ended up paying 5k
satoshis in chain and execution fees, netting a cool 35k satoshi yield. Within
the actual auction, these numbers will vary based on the chain fee rate, the
market prices, and also the execution fees. Users can constraint how much chain
fees they'll pay by setting the `--max_batch_fee_rate` argument when submitting
orders.

## Service Level Lifetime Enforcement

In the alpha version of Pool, _script level enforcement_ isn't yet implemented.
Script level enforcement would lock the maker's funds in the channel for the
lease period. This ensures that they can't just collect the premium (before
coupon channels) and close out the channel instantly. With script enforcement,
they would be able to close the channel (force close it), but their funds would
be unavailable until the maturity period has passed.

Instead, we've implemented a feature in `lnd` to prevent channels from being
_cooperatively closed_ by the maker until the expiry height (what we call the
`thaw_height`). Additionally, if we detect a force close by the maker of that
channel, then we'll ban them from the market for a set period of time.

# Prerequisites

To build and run LLM, the following tools/binaries must be installed on your
system:
* Go `1.13` or later
* `make`
* `lnd` version `v0.11.1-beta` or later with the build tags `signrpc`,
 `walletrpc`, `chainrpc` and `invoicesrpc` enabled (or the current `master`
  branch built with `make install tags="signrpc walletrpc chainrpc invoicesrpc"`
  if version`v0.11.1-beta` is not yet released).
