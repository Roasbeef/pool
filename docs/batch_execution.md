# Auction Batch Execution Lifecycle


## Batched Uniform-Price Clearing

Now that we have orders submitted, how does the rest of the auction actually
work? As mentioned above, Pool conducts a _discrete_ batch auction every 10
minutes. This is distinct from regular continuous exchanges in that orders are
only cleared every 10 minutes. Orders are also sealed-bid, meaning that other
traders in the venue are unable to see what others have bid. On top
of this, we utilize a uniform-clearing price algorithm to give all traders in
the batch the _same_ interest rate. This is the same mechanism used by the U.S
Treasury for its bonds, and is intended to promote fairness as your order will
only be matched with a price better than your initial ask/bid.

Note that it's possible that after the 10 minutes interval has passed a market
can't be made (supply and demand didn't cross). In this case, nothing happens,
and we just wait for the next batch to come across.

To illustrate how the uniform price clearing works consider the following
example. Let's say I want to buy 100 million satoshis (1 BTC, 1000 units), for 
at least 10 days (1440 blocks) at a price of 5% (using high numbers to make it 
easy to follow). However, the _market clearing price_ (where the supply+demand
curves cross) is actually 1%. In this case I bid _more_ than the market 
clearing price, but end up paying that price, as it's the best price that was 
possible in that market.

A simple rule of thumb for bids and asks is as follows:

  * When I submit a bid, I'll either pay that amount or less.
  * When I submit an ask, I'll either receive that amount or more.

All orders in a batch are executed in a _single_ on-chain transaction. This
allows for thousands of channels to be bought/sold atomically in a single
block. We call the transaction that executes the orders the Batch Execution
Transaction. 

The `pool auction` sub-command houses a number of useful commands to explore the
past batches, and examine the current auction parameters.

One can browse the latest cleared batch using the `pool auction snapshot`
command:

```

Here we see a batch where a single order was matched, at a clearing rate of
`976`, with a single channel being purchased with a lifetime of `1024` blocks,
or roughly one week.

Note that the `pool auction snapshot` command can be used to determine the past
marker clearing price, which can be useful when deciding what your bid/ask
should be. There's no explicit "market buy" function, but submitting a bid/ask
at a similar `clearing_price_rate` is equivalent.

The command also accept a target `batch_id` as well. Here we can use the
`prev_batch_id` to examine the _prior_ batch, similar to traversing a
link-listed/blockchain:
```
üèî pool auction snapshot --batch_id=03687baa3c7414e800ddba37edacb3281999739303b7290a69bd457f428ecd9b2c
```
